    <h4 class="odd">Description</h4><br/>


        Mastop Go2 is a new concept in Spotlights Management for XOOPS sites,
        following the standards of OO development, facilitating the inclusion of
        new resources. Even being simple, Mastop Go2 module came to meet the
        basic needs for any Xoops site: Let the site more beautiful and speed up
        the publication of any information, may it be written or graphical.<br/><br/>

    No special measures necessary, follow the standard installation process â€“

        To set up this module you need to:<br/><br/>
        i) Set the access permissions to anonymous users (only doing that you

        everywhere).)<br/><br/>
        ii) Go to administration and submit sections and spotlights.<br/><br/>
        iii) Go to Mastop Go2 Blocks Administration and active / configure /
        clone blocks as you want.<br/><br/>
        iv) If you want to use the Spotlights in other site (or if you want
        allow your guests to promote yours spotlights), go to Code Generator at
        the Home of your Mastop Go2.<br/><br/>
        v) Ensure that relevant user groups have access rights to a) the Polls
        module and b) the Polls block so that they can see it and vote. Detailed
